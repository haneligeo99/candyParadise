# candyParadise

Candy Paradise is a simple candy shop webssite that uses HTML, JS, and PHP to function. It has a login as soon as you enter making it an exclusive site, unless
you register. It has a shopping cart on the store page that is complete with a total count at the end. The total count is programmed to always shows the 
accurate total as you add or remove things from the cart. The plan is to update the candy weekly based off of user & candy crew favorites!
